A dark black and gray theme with gold/orange accents. 

## Description
Should be easier on the eyes than some of the other dark themes.

### Update History

<b>UPDATE - 2023-01-17:</b> There are updated manifest properties that will enable this theme to force dark-mode by default for menus and webpage content (see https://github.com/Zorziel/Dark-Gold/issues/5 for details).  If the manifest.json stays as v2 for this change, the next version will be `3.9.2`.  If I also migrate to v3, the next version will be `4.0.0`.  

#### Older Updates:
- <b>UPDATE - 2021-08-19 - Version 3.9.1:</b> changed the tab_background_text color slightly so that it once again triggers the dark context and system menus in the new UI. 
- <b>UPDATE - 2021-07-13 - Version 3.8:</b> Added popup_border color to remove the light-gray border on some popups and menus that were added in Firefox 90.0
- <b>UPDATE - 2021-07-05 - Version 3.7:</b> Tweaked tab_line color again. This time it actually does highlight the current tab better than before. 
- <b>UPDATE - 2021-06-18:</b> I have uploaded some forks of this theme with different accent colors as requested by some users. This is still the primary theme and I will continue to update this one first and then apply any new changes to the various other colors. I'm hoping that Mozilla adds some more options to control the new UI so that I can theme the modals and context menu without the need for a full extension. 
- <b>UPDATE - 2021-06-09 - Version 3.6:</b> Modified the color of the "tab line" to allow a slightly more pronounced <i>hover</i> effect for the selected tab. 
- <b>UPDATE - 2021-06-01 - Version 3.5:</b> Added new entries for Firefox 89 and tweaked some elements for the new look of Firefox. If you do not like the new look or are using an ESR release of Firefox, you can still find the previous/older versions here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dark-gold/versions/
